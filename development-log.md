| 1          | 9th Nov, 2019<br>Saturday<br>1:30 pm      | Terminal App Idea                     | On week 4 Saturday 9th Nov, I, spoke with Bianca for my terminal apps. I decided to do the Words Guessing game. <br>The game would basically generate scrambled words from randomly, picked words from the collection of words. The <br>user would have to correctly guess the right word. Words will be either picked from seperate files that will have collection <br>of words or user Faker. Another alternative was to use API to get words from the some Dictionary or other sources from <br>Internet. The game will have different levels depending such as Easy, Difficult and really Hard. It will also score user <br>depending upon the right guess they make. I was advised by Bianca to start with just the basic functionality of the app <br>which will be the Donut for the app. I completely agree with her and planned to start with the basic features of the app that<br> will make it functional and do what it intends to do in the basic level. |
| 2          | 13th Nov, 2019<br>Wednesday<br>12:15 am   | Major change with the functionality   | As I was developing the game, I realised that if I am making game for the kids it should be fun and challenging as well.<br>Therefore; I decided to introduce two players in my game that will challenge each other and there will be winner at the end. So <br>I won't be getting words from other resources. Instead one player will input the word which will be shuffled and scrambled into<br>meaningless word. The other player will have to guess the right word to score points. After one player will finish with guessing, <br>the game will switch the players and another player has to guess the word. Both the players score will update at the end<br>and winners will be discussed.<br><br>I discussed my idea with Bianca and Alex our senior dev and lecturer on 14th Nov 2019, Thursday. They were happy with the<br>whole concept and got a green signal to start building it.                                                                      |
| 3          | 15th Nov, 2019<br>Friday<br>3: 20 pm      | Struggling with switching the players | Although I have finished most part of the game; switching between the players have been really challenging for me. I spoke with<br>Alex, our Senior dev about the issue. He advised me to use methods in my game. As I am not comfortable with using methods;<br>I am bit hesitant. I am trying for other possible ways to do it. I haven't come up with solution yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4          | 16th Nov, 2019<br><br>Saturday<br>7:30 pm | Switching player successfull          | Finally I am able to switch the players in the game.  Thanks to Alex, who taught me how to use methods today in the class. I am <br>really happy with the output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## **Description**
Unscramble The Scramble is the word guessing game. This game is targeted generally for kindergarten kids, however; it will suit any age groups. The game aims to make learning and retaining the words and vocabulary less stressful and more fun both for kids and parents. As this game can be played between the friends by challanging each other, it will make it competitive aswell.

The game has two players.One player will input the word which will be than scrambled into meaningless word and another player has to unscramble this word. Whoever makes the must guesses will win the game.
